// There is deliberately no panel-wide backdrop: the window is fully transparent and each capsule,

//
// In ADAPTIVE mode the content is appearance-agnostic (`.primary`/`.secondary`, never hardcoded
// white) and the glass is applied *to the content view itself*, never stacked behind it as a
// sibling layer. That distinction is what makes those styles pick up vibrancy and track the
// backdrop; as a detached `.background { }` the glass adapted but its icons and text stayed locked
// to the system-appearance colour and went unreadable on dark wallpapers.
//
// In a PINNED mode that same vibrancy is the bug rather than the feature — it is what dragged the
// panel back to the wallpaper a second after it opened. Pinned modes therefore give up `glassEffect`
// entirely and render as glassmorphism instead. See `GlassmorphicPane`.

/// The glassmorphism recipe used by the pinned themes: a blurred pane, a translucent wash that fixes
/// the tone, a highlight gathering along the top-left edge, and a shadow lifting it off the desktop.
///
/// Pinned themes cannot use `glassEffect`. Its backdrop is the *window's* backdrop, and nothing drawn
/// inside the window can occlude that — a fill was tried on both sides of the glass and neither
/// worked. In front of it, the fill veiled the glass into a flat plate while the glass underneath
/// went on sampling. Behind it, the fill only ever lands beneath the glass's own render, so the panel
/// lost its translucency *and* the glass on top still tracked whatever sat behind the window — other
/// apps' windows as much as the wallpaper. Apple exposes no way to redirect that backdrop, so
/// holding a theme means building the pane by hand.
///
/// Glassmorphism is the right idiom for that, and it pins better than a thicker material would. A
/// material still *averages* whatever is behind it, so buying tone from thickness alone costs
